🔹 Step 2: Set Up Your Branching Strategy

To keep the repository structured, always work on feature branches instead of modifying the main branch directly.

Create a new branch:

git checkout -b feature-authentication

After making changes, commit and push:

git add .
git commit -m "Implemented authentication logic"
git push origin feature-authentication

Open a Pull Request (PR) from GitHub and request a review before merging into main.

📌 2. Create a GitHub Project Board

GitHub Project Board helps manage tasks efficiently using a Kanban board.

🔹 Step 1: Create a Project Board

Navigate to the Projects tab in your repository.

Click New Project → Select Board.

Name it User Management Development.

Choose Automated Kanban.

🔹 Step 2: Define Columns (Kanban Board)

To Do – Tasks to be done.

In Progress – Ongoing work.

Review – Work pending code review.

Done – Completed tasks.

✅ 3. Organize Work with Issues & Tasks

GitHub Issues help track progress on user stories and tasks.

🔹 Step 1: Create Issues from the Product Backlog

Go to the Issues tab.

Click New Issue → Add a task from the backlog.

Assign it to a team member.

Link it to the Project Board.

🔹 Step 2: Work on Issues

Move the task from To Do → In Progress when working.

Merge the PR and move it to Done.

🛠 4. Collaborate Efficiently

🔹 Step 1: Communicate with GitHub Discussions

Use the Discussions tab for Q&A.

Comment on Issues for updates.

Use commit messages to explain changes.

🔹 Step 2: Review Code Before Merging

Every PR should be reviewed by another student.

Add comments & suggestions before merging.

🔐 5. Advanced Authentication Features

For Epic 3, we will implement Advanced Authentication, including:✔️ Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)✔️ Sign-up with Email & GitHub API✔️ Validate accounts via email✔️ Sign-up using Face Recognition API

These features will be assigned as Issues in the Project Board.

🏆 6. Final Steps: Submit & Review

Ensure all assigned tasks are completed and moved to Done.

Review your peers' code and provide feedback.

Submit the final project version via a PR to main.
